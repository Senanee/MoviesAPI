This Project was developed ASP.Net Core and Angular 17 with DBFirst approach.
Please create db named "Movies" on your localDb and run the file SQLQuery1.sql to create the tables and other.
build the MoviesApi project and start debugging. You could use OpenApi (swagger) to test the API.
Orderby parameter accepts comma-separated strings Eg "Title,-ReleaseDate" this will order result by title asc and then ReleaseDate desc.

Angular project is under MoviesAPI/ClientApp folder.
The Angular project lacks the Orderby feature implementation on the table.
